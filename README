Jenkins command line interface

This is a command line interface to Jenkins, so you can launch your builds
from your shell and never leave your terminal!

The following commands are available:

 - `jobs`: List all available jobsm with their last build status
 - `views`: List all the views defined on the Jenkins instance
 - `build [jobname]`: Schedule a build for the job `jobname`

The command line tool will prompt you for the Jenkins instance you want to
connect to. You can configure the Jenkins endpoint permanently by editing
the jkcli configuration file. Place a JSON file at ~/.jkcli.rc with the 
following content:

    {
      "host": "http://www.example.com/"
    }

This way, jkcli will never prompt you for the Jenkins host again and will use
this value by default.

You can contribute by submitting code and issues on the Github project at
<https://github.com/VivienBarousse/jkcli>.
